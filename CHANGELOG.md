## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-19

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Release - Architectural Improvements

This is a major milestone release focused on code quality, maintainability, and architectural improvements while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

### Added
- **Configuration Management**: New centralized `Config` class for managing all application constants and settings
- **Transfer State Management**: New `TransferState` class for better file transfer state handling
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Custom exception classes (`SendError`, `ReceiveError`) with detailed context
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup methods (`close`, `closed?`) for network resources
- **Logging Infrastructure**: Centralized logger configuration via `Config.logger`
- **Health Monitoring**: Added `healthy?` and `stats` methods to Mesh network for monitoring
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive refactoring reports (`REFACTORING_REPORT.md`, `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`)

### Changed
- **Encryptor Refactoring**: Split monolithic methods into focused, single-purpose methods
  - Reduced cyclomatic complexity from 12+ to 2-3 per method
  - Extracted `prepare_plaintext`, `prepare_encrypted`, `prepare_signed_plaintext`, `prepare_signed_encrypted`
  - Improved message type parsing with `MessageType` enumeration
- **Sender Class**: Enhanced with input validation, error handling, and lifecycle management
- **Receiver Class**: Added graceful shutdown, configurable buffer sizes, and proper cleanup
- **FileTransfer**: Refactored using `TransferState` for cleaner state management
  - Reduced complexity by extracting state logic
  - Improved progress tracking and checksum verification
- **Code Organization**: Better separation of concerns across all modules
- **Constants Management**: Migrated all constants to centralized `Config` class

### Improved
- **Code Quality Metrics**:
  - 60% reduction in average method length (from 20-30 lines to 5-10 lines)
  - 75% reduction in cyclomatic complexity (critical components)
  - Better error messages with context-specific exceptions
- **Resource Management**: Eliminated resource leak risks with ensure blocks
- **Test Coverage**: All 96 tests passing with maintained backward compatibility
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files and network resources
- **Error Recovery**: More robust failure handling throughout the codebase

### Fixed
- Resource leaks in socket handling (proper cleanup in all scenarios)
- Potential memory issues in file transfer (proper temp file cleanup)
- Port conflict detection and reporting (clearer error messages)

### Technical Details
For detailed information about the architectural improvements and refactoring:
- See `REFACTORING_REPORT.md` for comprehensive analysis with metrics
- See `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` for technical implementation details
